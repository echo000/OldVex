# Vex

Vex is an asset extractor for various titles running on the Void Engine.
Supported games are Dishonored 2, Death of the Outsider (WIP) & Deathloop.
This is not currently being worked on as it has been re-written in Rust.

Note that a fresh build will not work due to the lack of animation module, you will need to comment out ExportVoidAnimation in VoidSupport.cs to get it to build.

Press P to preview Models/Textures in the viewer. (Note that models can take a while to load if loading with textures due to needing to build the textures)

## Requirements

* Windows 11 x64 or above (Windows 7/8/8.1/10 should work, but are untested)
* .NET Core 9 (Technically would build with .NET 8 but would require some changes)
* Official copies of the games (only the latest copies from official distributors are tested)
* General understanding of how to use the assets you want to work with

The following tools/plugins are required/recommended for some assets:

* [Cast](https://github.com/dtzxporter/Cast) by DTZxPorter (.cast) (Autodesk Maya/Blender)
* [SETools](https://github.com/dtzxporter/SETools) by DTZxPorter (.seanim & .semodel) (Autodesk Maya)
* [io_anim_seanim](https://github.com/SE2Dev/io_anim_seanim) by SE2Dev (.seanim) (Blender)
* [io_model_semodel](https://github.com/dtzxporter/io_model_semodel) by DTZxPorter (.semodel) (Blender)
* [FileTypeDDS](https://github.com/dtzxporter/FileTypeDDS) by DTZxPorter (support in Paint .NET for newer DXGI formats) (Paint .NET)
* [Intel TextureWorks](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-texture-works-plugin) by Intel (DDS + Utils) (Photoshop)
* [SEModelViewer](https://github.com/Scobalula/semodelviewer) by Scobalula

Note that SEModel/Anim plugins are not directly supported in Maya or Blender anymore, and would recommend using Cast.
